# Linked List

A **linked list** organizes items sequentially, with each item storing a pointer to the next one.

Picture a linked list like a chain of paperclips linked together. It's quick to add another paperclip to the top or bottom. It's even quick to insert one in the middleâ€”just disconnect the chain at the middle link, add the new paperclip, then reconnect the other half.

An item in a linked list is called a **node**. The first node is called the **head**. The last node is called the **tail**.

> Confusingly, somtimes people use the word tail to refer to "the whole rest of the list after the head."

> Unlike an array, consecutive items in a linked list are not necessarily next to each other in memory.

## Strengths:
* **Fast operations on the ends.** Adding elements at either end of a linked list is $O(1)$. Removing the first element is also $O(1)$.
* **Flexible size.** There's no need to specify how many elements you're going to store ahead of time. You can keep adding elements as long as there's enough space on the machine.

## Weaknesses:
* **Costly lookups.** To access or edit an item in a linked list, you have to take $O(i)$ time to walk from the head of the list to the iith item.

## Uses:
**Stacks** and **queues** only need fast operations on the ends, so linked lists are ideal.

## In Python
Most languages (including Python) don't provide a linked list implementation. Assuming we've already implemented our own, here's how we'd construct the linked list above:

```python
a = LinkedListNode(5)
b = LinkedListNode(1)
c = LinkedListNode(9)

a.next = b
b.next = c
```

## Doubly Linked Lists

In a basic linked list, each item stores a single pointer to the next element.

In a **doubly linked list**, items have pointers to the next and the previous nodes.

Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards. In a singly linked list, if you just had a pointer to a node in the middle of a list, there would be no way to know what nodes came before it. Not a problem in a doubly linked list.

## Not cache-friendly
Most computers have [caching systems that make reading from sequential addresses in memory faster than reading from scattered addresses](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/data-structures-coding-interview#ram).

**Array** items are always located right next to each other in computer memory, but linked list nodes can be scattered all over.

So iterating through a linked list is usually quite a bit slower than iterating through the items in an array, even though they're both theoretically $O(n)$ time.
